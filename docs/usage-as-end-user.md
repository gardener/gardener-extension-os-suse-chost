# Using the SUSE JeOS extension with Gardener as end-user

The [`core.gardener.cloud/v1beta1.Shoot` resource](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/example/90-shoot.yaml) declares a few fields that must be considered when this OS extension is used.

In this document we describe how this configuration looks like and under which circumstances your attention may be required.

## AWS VPC settings for SUSE JeOS workers

Gardener allows you to create SUSE JeOS based worker nodes by:
1. Using a Gardener managed VPC
2. Reusing a VPC that already exists (VPC `id` specified in [InfrastructureConfig](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-provider-aws/blob/master/docs/usage-as-end-user.md#infrastructureconfig)]

If the second option applies to your use-case please make sure that your VPC has enabled **DNS Support**. Otherwise SUSE JeOS based nodes aren't able to join or operate in your cluster properly.

**[DNS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html)** settings (required):

- `enableDnsHostnames`: true
- `enableDnsSupport`: true
